                <article>
                <p style="clear:both">I began my career in 2005 as a systems developer and consultant in the oil and gas industry. I specialized in Java and C# development, working on thermodynamic simulations used by
                        <b>General Electric</b> and helping the <b>National Institute of Standards and Technology</b> create
                        B2B electronic data exchange standards for capital
                            facilities and hydraulic systems.
               
                </p>
                <p>
                    Building things people actually use is my passion.  In 2006 I earned a Ph.D. from Lehigh University in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/1195439">human computer interaction</a>, 
                    and I've leveraged those skills in every application I create - designing software that's easy for your users to learn and use. 
                    I combine that with deep software engineering experience, and it's allowed me to take on projects in all sorts of domains.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've created software to design oil and gas industrial equipment, track and detect aircraft 
                    using 3D cameras, and analyze genomes.  I've gotten to develop AI-driven computer vision security 
                    systems, mobile apps to manage construction sites, accounting software, finance/trading platforms, 
                    consumer ratings portals, and more.  
                </p>
                <p>

                    Believe it or not, every one of those (except the aircraft detection...) has been a web application 
                    at their core - just with a lot of engineering behind the scenes.  I've worked dozens of web frameworks,
                    databases, and languages - and I can help you pick the right one for your project.
